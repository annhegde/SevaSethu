## Technology Stack:
  * Frontend: FlutterFlow - A great choice for rapid UI development.
  * Backend: Supabase - Offers database, authentication, and serverless functions.
  * CI/CD: Buildship - Streamlines the build and deployment process.
  * API Integration: Azure Functions - Enables interaction with Google Maps and Gemini APIs.
  

### App Structure and Pages:
  * Login/Signup:
    - Separate logins for citizens and government officials.
  * Citizen:
    * Home:
      - Displays grievances raised by the user, userâ€™s residential area and any ongoing works in the area.
    * Map View:
      -Displays the user's location with the static satellite image from Google Maps.
    * Grievance List:
      - Shows AI-generated and user-generated grievances for the area.
    * Grievance Details: 
      - Shows details of the grievance (type, description, images, location).
      - Allows citizens to upvote/downvote and comment.
      - Shows the status of the grievance and government response (if any).
  
  * Raise Grievance: Form for users to submit their own concerns with image upload options.
  * Official:
    - Home & Dashboard: Overview of open grievances, categorized by location and severity.
    - Grievance Details: Similar to the citizen view, with additional options for officials to respond and update the status.
  * Profile: Both citizens and officials can manage their profiles and settings.
  * Design and Colors:
  * Color Scheme: Opt for a palette that reflects trust, efficiency, and civic engagement. Consider using shades of green (growth, progress), blue (trust, stability), and saffron/orange (energy, optimism), which align with Indian national colors.
  * Design: Keep the interface clean and intuitive. Prioritize accessibility and readability, especially for rural users who may have older devices or limited data. Use clear icons and labels, and ensure the app works well in different Indian languages.

## Implementation Steps:
### API Integration:
1. Set up Azure Functions to handle requests to Google Maps Static API and Gemini API.
2. Retrieve satellite images and analyze them using the Gemini API within the Azure Function.
3. Return the analysis results and possible grievances to the FlutterFlow app.
### FlutterFlow Development:
1. Design the UI screens and navigation flow using FlutterFlow's visual editor.
2. Connect the app to Supabase for user authentication, data storage, and real-time updates.
3. Implement features like map view, grievance lists, image uploads, and commenting.
4. Integrate with the Azure Functions for image analysis and grievance generation.
### Build and Deployment:
1. Utilize Buildship to automate the build process and deploy the app to the chosen platform (Android/iOS).
2. Set up a CI/CD pipeline for continuous integration and delivery.
3. Additional Considerations:
4. Data Security: Ensure user data is encrypted and stored securely.
5. Scalability: Design the app to handle a large number of users and grievances.
6. Accessibility: Make the app accessible to users with disabilities.
